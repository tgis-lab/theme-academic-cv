The Vitality Data Center (VDC) project is a joint project between Utrecht University and Eindhoven University of Technology and part of Vitality Academy (https://vitalityacademy.eu/about/). The VDC project addresses vitality and public health related issues, and aims at 1. developing a data platform that can facilitate various vitality-related ‘living lab’ projects; 2. investigating the relationship between physical activities and built environments (such as green spaces and street networks). The developments from the project can be found in the Github repository, https://github.com/vitality-data-center.
